# stripe-woocommerce-webhook-handler

This is a simple webhook handler for WooCommerce that listens for Stripe events and updates the order status accordingly.

It can be used to create a WooCommerce order when a new order is created in Stripe, or to update the status of an existing order when a payment is received.
